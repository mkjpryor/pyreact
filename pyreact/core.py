"""
This module contains the core of pyreact, i.e. the portion that is responsible for
maintaining the data-flow graph and propagating updates through it

Unless explicitly told otherwise, emitters maintain only weak references to their
children, so a child can be garbage collected if the only references to it are held
by emitters

In contrast, reactors maintain hard references to their parents, so an emitter
can only be garbage collected if there are no direct references to it and it has
no children

Inspiration comes from:

  * scala.rx (https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala.rx)
  * Knockout (http://knockoutjs.com/)
  * Bacon.js (https://baconjs.github.io/)
